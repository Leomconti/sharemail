# Share Mail

Had this idea because I received a very nice email update of an application we use at work, and wanted to share with the team.
I didn't want to forward to each one of them, so I created this to give them a link to access it. 

1. Forward the email you want publicly available to `setYourEmail`
2. You will receive a reply with a shareable link where the email content was published
3. Share the link instead of forwarding the email to multiple recipients
