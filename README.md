Had this idea because I received a very nice email update of an application we use at work, and wanted to share with the team.
I didn't want to forward to each one of them, so I created this to give them a link to access it.

1. Forward the email you want publicly available to `setYourEmail`
2. You will receive a reply with a shareable link where the email content was published
3. Share the link instead of forwarding the email to multiple recipients

## To run

1. Clone the repository
2. Set env variables, set up resend to send emails and some gmail oauth2
3. Run `pnpm install`
4. Run `pnpm start`
5. It will open a browser window to authorize the access to the email to read contents from
6. You will receive a reply with a shareable link where the email content was published
